## Summary

Calculates the average of a field in a specified table in the current record. Calculated results can be used in other actions.

## How to use

### Parameters to set

Set the fields to be calculated.

#### Calculated fields

Select the field in the table for which you want to calculate the average. You can select a number or a calculated field.

#### Field to set result (optional)

Specify this when setting the calculation result to another field. If you do not set it in the direct field but want to use the calculation result in another action, you can omit it.

## Precautions

We do not rounding the results of the calculation here. Separate [Round the value of a field](../../field/round4d5u_field/), and so on.
