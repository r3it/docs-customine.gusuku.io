## Summary

Gets the group (role) to which the currently logged in user belongs.

## How to use

When this action is executed, the information of the group to which it belongs is saved as the result of the action.

It is also possible to refer to this information from $1 etc using an expression.
But more typical usage is to combine it with [belonging to a designated group / organization](../../../conditions/condition_other_if/if_user_belongs_to/).
