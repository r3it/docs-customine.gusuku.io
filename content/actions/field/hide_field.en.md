-	If you hide a column in the record details screen, the column remains hidden when the user navigates to the record edit screen with the edit icon.
	-	If you want to hide it in the detail screen or display it in the edit screen, go to [Show fields and groups](../show_field/) action to be performed.
-	[Spread a table](../../table/set_handsontable/) can not be combined with this.
