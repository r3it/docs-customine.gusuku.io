## Summary

Perform an action when a record is automatically saved by Customine.

## How to use

Customine does not save records on the original kintone screen, such as the edit screen or the list screen, but when you perform an action that modifies the field value, autosave records.

Specify this When a record is automatically saved if you want to take any other action when this feature saves the record.

In a typical example, when a record is automatically saved, the [Reload the screen](../../../actions/other_ui/reload_page/) can be used like this.

### Parameters to set

There are no parameters.
